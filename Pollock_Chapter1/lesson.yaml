  AnswerTests: val_matches('*')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: text_question
  Output: A political science major wants to use R's plot function to create a compelling graphic. The student plans to follow an example that uses a dozen optional arguments to make labels, modify colors, and implement other refinements. Why should the student start with a bare minimum plot and add optional arguments one at a time?
  CorrectAnswer: e
